A basic & extensible web framework in Go.

https://thrisp.github.io/flotilla/

Quickstart:

Flotilla can be installed with 

    go get -u github.com/thrisp/flotilla.

There is one external dependency beyond the standard library, to ensure default html templating is handled: [Djinn](https://github.com/thrisp/djinn/).

While the dependency is a requirement,handling templates is something you can modify to your preference.

See https://thrisp.github.io/flotilla/start/ for an example flotilla instance.
